# GitHub Profile Finder

I developed this responsive project using the React framework (or library...nobody knows). 

It's a GitHub Profile Finder where users can type a username to find a specific profile. 

If this profile does not exist, the user will see a "USER NOT FOUND" message. 

If the profile exists, a list of repositories will be loaded so that the user can view the information and access the URLs.
